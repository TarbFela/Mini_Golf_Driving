This is a project created for ECE 198 - Object Oriented Programming in Python. It's in Python and it uses objects, takes advantage of object-oriented concepts such as inheritence, abstraction, etc., and is generally a cool project. 

The project was educational and taught me how to create modules, save data, use the PyGame module, and more.

To play, first ensure that Python is installed as well as the PyGame module. Then, run main.py.
